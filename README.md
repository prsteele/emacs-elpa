# Overview

This repository is merely a historical copy of various packages
installed for Emacs. Emacs package archives don't typically allow
rolling back versions, so if a package update breaks your workflow it
can be tedious to recover a working version.

I'm attempting to solve this problem by simply tracking my
dependencies here.

## Installation

This repository is designed to be cloned to
`~/.emacs.d/elpa`.
